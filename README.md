# TicTacToe-React

This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game built using React. It's a two-player turn-based game where players alternate between 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The game detects the winner once a player aligns three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay with alternating moves
- Displays the current player (`X` or `O`)
- Highlights the winner when a player wins
- Ability to go back to any previous move in the game history

## Tech Stack
- **React**: Used for building the user interface with functional components and hooks.
- **CSS**: For styling the game layout.

## How to Play
1. Players take turns to click on a square on the board.
2. The first player to align three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
3. If the board is filled and no one has won, the game is a draw.
4. You can also navigate back to previous moves to replay the game.
